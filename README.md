# NYC Geoclient Python Bindings

Python bindings for the REST [NYC Geoclient API][api].

  [api]: http://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api-beta

This version is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/talos/nyc-geoclient) which has been lightly modified for cross-version compatibility (the original version of this library is Python 2-only).

You can install this version of the client using `pip` with `pip install git+git://github.com/ResidentMario/nyc-geoclient`.
